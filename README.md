    - The Django web framework was used to create the web API.

1. [PostgreSQL:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)
    - PostgreSQL was used as the object-relational database system.

1. [ElephantSQL:](https://www.elephantsql.com/)
    - ElephantSQL was used to host the database.

1. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

1. [Heroku:](https://heroku.com/)
    - Heroku was used for the deployed application.


## __Testing__

### ***Python Testing***

<!-- -   [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the Python code in this project. All code passed without errors, except `settings.py` and `env.py` which showed E501 'line too long' warnings.

    ![Results Python Environment Variables](docs/readme/images/testing/validator-env-py.png) -->

### ***Manual Testing***

<!-- - Manual testing was performed app-wide to ensure a smooth and positive user experience. 

- Consistent testing was carried out to ensure there was a logical flow when using the app, and that user's expectations for where links would take them, and what would follow user actions were respected.

- Alert messages are displayed when a user has completed an action, to explain why they are not seeing any data, or if input is incorrect or required:
